# Code-Refractor

## Description
I made this website more accessible and a bit cleaner. Accessiblity is important, and we need to make sure that all potential customers can access our webpage. All links now work, and the HTML and CSS follow semantic structure. Excess CSS has also been removed. All this not only allows other coders to work better in the future with this code, but also screen readers are better able to describe the website.

I learned a lot from this project, such as the importance of comments and a logical structure to CSS.
